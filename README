|Introduction|

OpenViBE is a software platform for the design, test and use of
Brain-Computer Interfaces. This document provides basic
information on what you just downloaded.

|Code.source.access|

The source code of the project can be found on the INRIA gForge :

https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/openvibe/ (welcome page)
https://gforge.inria.fr/mail/?group_id=276 (mailing lists)
http://www.irisa.fr/bunraku/OpenViBE/forum (forums)
https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?group_id=276 (bug tracker)

Getting the latest (unstable) version of the source code from the forge can
be done thanks to this command :

svn checkout svn+ssh://developername@scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/openvibe/trunk

|Repository.organisation|

The project repository is composed of several software modules. Each software
module can have its own branches and tags and is compiled separately
from other modules. The repository basically looks like this :

root of the repository
 + <openvibe> (API / specifications)
 + <openvibe-kernel> (kernel implementation)
 + <openvibe-toolkit> (development help components)
 + <openvibe-applications> (OpenViBE user applications)
    + <acquisition-server>
    + <designer>
    + ...
 + <openvibe-plugins> (OpenViBE plugin collections)
    + <samples>
    + <acquisition>
    + ...
 + <openvibe-modules> (abstraction and portability components)
    + <ebml>
    + <socket>
    + ...

Each software module has its own subtree which looks like the following:

root of the module
 + <trunc> (current unstable version)
 + <tags> (tagged versions)
    + 0.0.1
    + ...
 + <branches> (work in progress, probably very unstable)
    + wip-developer1
    + wip-...

Finally, in each branch, each software module is divided in the following UNIX-like tree :

+ <bin> (target folder for compiled binaries)
+ <doc> (target folder for compiled documentation)
+ <etc> (target folder for configuration files)
+ <include> (target folder for API headers)
+ <lib> (target folder for compiled libraries)
+ <share> (shared file folder for all data)
+ <src> (source code of the module)
   + <doc> (documentation files for the module)
+ <test> (unit test source code for the module)
