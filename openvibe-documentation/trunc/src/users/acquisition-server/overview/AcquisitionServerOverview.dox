\section Doc_AcquisitionServerOverview_Introduction Introduction

OpenViBE Acquisition Server is a tool designed to communicate with hardware signal acquisition devices and forward acquired signals and other experiment information to OpenViBE applications in
a way compliant with the OpenViBE format specification. 

The acquisition server doesn't communicate directly with acquisition devices. Instead, it provides the user with a set of drivers to choose from, each one being 
dedicated to a given device model. New devices can be supported by the server by developing new drivers. See \ref Doc_CreatingANewDriver for details on this.

\section Doc_AcquisitionServerOverview_Configuration Configuration

Let's have a look at the graphical interface of the acquisition server tool to present what parameters must be configured before it can be used to acquire and forward data. 
The server GUI should look like the following :

\subsection Doc_AcquisitionServerOverview_Drivers Acquisition Device Drivers

A list of available drivers is accessible under 'drivers'. Depending on your distribution of OpenViBE, 
a number of drivers may already be at hand. At least one driver should be available : the Generic Oscillator. Contrary to most drivers, this one doesn't connect to
any hardware device, but generates sinusoidal signals. It is appropriate for testing purposes. 
To change the default driver presented when launching the Acquisition Server, add the following token to your configuration file :
\code
# set the default driver :
AcquisitionServer_DefaultDriver = Generic Raw Telnet Reader
\endcode
If you don't specify any driver that way, the driver presented upon startup is the latest used during previous execution.

\subsection Doc_AcquisitionServerOverview_ConnectionSettings Connection Settings

In order to use a driver, connection details should be set so that the server communicates with connected OpenViBE applications as desired. The port to which to send data can 
be changed under 'Connection Port' (e.g. 1024 is a standard default setting). An OpenViBE application will then have to fetch data from this port once an experiment is started.
Also, the size of the buffers sent to connected applications may be configured under 'Sample count per sent block'. This defines how many samples should be sent per 
acquired channel in a single buffer. Valid values are powers-of-two and 32 is the default. The duration or 'epoch' a buffer corresponds to depends on the sampling frequency, which
may be set in the Driver Properties dialog (see \ref Doc_AcquisitionServerOverview_DriverProperties) 

\subsection Doc_AcquisitionServerOverview_DriverProperties Driver Properties

Once a driver is selected from the drop-down list and before it can be used, its settings should be configured appropriately. Settings provide information about the experiment
being conducted and the subject undergoing the experiment. The 'Driver Properties' button pops up the settings dialog of the currently selected driver. 
It displays settings that can't be retrieved from the hardware and that have to be filled up by the user. They may vary between drivers. For example, the Generic Oscillator 
settings include information about the subject (identifier, age, gender) and the experiment (number of channels to be acquired, sampling frequency, channel names).

\subsection Doc_AcquisitionServerOverview_Drift Acquition Server Preferences

Various global settings can be accessed through the 'Preferences' button.
Most users will leave these parameters as default.

The Acquisition Server monitors the behaviour of the driver in order to ensure that it actually sends the number of samples it should, regarding the theorical sampling 
frequency of the device. When a drift is detected, you will see a progress bar going on the left or right (not enough or too much samples). When the drift reaches a 
threshold, an automatic correction is done : the Acquisition Server removes or duplicates some samples, and sends stimulation(s) to any acquisition client connected, 
so you can know in the signal that a correction just occured. The stimulations used are tagged \b OVTK_GDF_Correct and \b OVTK_GDF_Incorrect. 

Here is the parameters you can set for the the Drift Correction:
- \b Drift \b correction : either Forced, Disabled, or driver dependant.
- \b Drift \b Tolerance (ms) : when reaching a drift duration of that value, a correction is triggered.
- \b Jitter \b Estimation \b Count \b for \b Drift : the window in number of "block" used to compute the drift.

The other settings are :
- \b Oversampling \b Factor : multiply the sampling frequency of the acquired signal, using linear interpolation.
- \b Impedance \b Check : some drivers make use of the Acquisition Server impedance checker, this functionnality can be turned on.

\section Doc_AcquisitionServerOverview_Usage Usage

Once a device driver has been selected and relevant settings configured, data acquisition can start. The server should first connect to the acquisition device, which
is done by clicking the 'Connect' button. A label will inform the user whether the connection was successful.

If the connection was established and the device(s) successfully connected, data sampling can be started/stopped by clicking 'Play'/'Stop'. 

Once a driver is 'connected' and 'playing', the clients (e.g. acquisition client boxes in a Designer scenario) may be started : press 'play' in the designer. Data should be received, decoded and sent through the openvibe pipeline you deisgned.

In the acquisition server window, you should see the number of client connected to your server (e.g. '2 hosts connected')

If you don't receive any signal from the acquisition client (e.g. you don't manage to display any signal), look in the console. If you find the following message :
\code
[WARNING] At time 402653184 (0x18000000) <Box algorithm::Acquisition client> Could not receive memory buffer size
[WARNING] Box algorithm <Acquisition client> has been deactivated because process phase returned bad status
\endcode
The acquisition server is connected, but stopped. Press 'Play' in the acquisition server then play your scenario again.
