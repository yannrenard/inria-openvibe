 * In case of problem, please contact the original authors.

 * Meanwhile, the \e p300-speller and \e p300-speller-xDAWN scenarios included in the \e share/openvibe-scenarios/bci
 * can be used for the same purpose.
 *
 * \section Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Principle Principle :
 *
 * The user focuses attention on one of the 36 character cells of a 6 x 6 matrix while each
 * row and column of the matrix is intensified in a random sequence. The row and column
 * intensifications that intersect at the attended cell represent the target stimuli, which
 * occur with a probability of 1/6. The rare presentation of the target stimuli in the random
 * sequence of stimuli constitutes an Oddball Paradigm and will elicit a P300 response to the
 * target stimuli. With proper P300 feature selection and classification, the attended
 * character of the matrix can be identified and communicated.

 *
 * \subsubsection Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Protocol_Step1_Acquisition Data acquisition
 *
 * - Acquisition EEG activity was recorded continuously from 32 active electrodes (actiCap,
 *   Brain Products GmbH, Munich), referenced to the nose and grounded to the forehead.
 * - EEG signals were band pass filtered between 0.1-150 Hz, amplified and digitized at a
 *   rate of <b><em>100 Hz</em></b>
 *
 * \subsubsection Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Protocol_Step1_OpenViBEScenario OpenViBE Scenario
 *
 * - Configuration of Acquisition server
 *   - Select the <em>BrainAmp Scalp EEG driver</em>
 * \image html Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Image2.png
 *   - Select <b>2</b> <em>samples count per send block</em> (in case of an acquisition at 100 Hz)
 *   - Configure, in Properties, the <em>Connection host name</em> of the BrainAmp Computer 
 * - Select and open the scenario entitled \c RecordingData2GDF.xml
 * \image html Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Image3.png
 * - It is composed of :
 *   - <em>Acquisition client Box</em>: open a socket to read experiment information, signal, 
 *     stimulations and channel localization data sent across the network.
 *   - <em>Temporal filter Box</em>: digitally filter EEG signal with a band-pass filter
 *     (Butterworth filter, 0.1-20 Hz, slope 24 dB/octave)
 * \image html Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Image4.png
 *   - <em>GDF file writer</em>: dump on disk the filtered EEG data in the standard GDF file
 *     format during the Training phase
 *
 * \subsection Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Protocol_Step2 2st step: Learning phase (MATLAB procedure)
 *
 * After the training phase of <b>50 letters</b>, the EEG data were saving in GDF format and an offline
 * analysis was done in MATLAB to estimate the settings of a Spatial Filter box and a Classifier
 * box using in the online phase.
 *
 * The recorded EEG signals contain P300 potentials as well as other brain activities, muscular
 * and/or ocular artifacts leading to a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of P300 potential.
 * An unsupervised algorithm is proposed to enhance P300 evoked potentials by estimating spatial
 * filters [Rivet 2009].
 *
 * Among the proposed classifiers for BCIs, Na誰ve Bayesian classifier is chosen.
 *
 * As already noticed by Rivet, only a few number of spatial filters is necessary to improve the
 * classification accuracy. Then, to estimate the best training of the spatial filters and the
 * Naive Bayes classifier, a leave-one-out strategy for cross-validation for each using of
 * 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 spatial filters is estimated by the following MATLAB function (toolbox <b>BIOSIG</b>
 * required) located in \c /openvibe/matlab/OV_P300 :
 *
 * \code
 * function ov_run_learning_p300(WordTrain,TrainGDF)
 * \endcode
 *
 * with \c WordTrain is the word (or non-word) of 50 letters and \c TrainGDF the GDF file containing
 * EEG and stimulations data recorded during training phase.
 *
 * This function computes also the Spatial Filter and Classifier parameters for different numbers
 * of repetitions (3, 5, 8 or 10 repetitions) and have been saved in the \c /openvibe/BoxSettings_XML folder.
 *
 * Finally, the Spatial Filter settings are stored respectably for 10, 8, 5 and 3 repetitions in
 * the following files:
 *  - \c /openvibe/BoxSettings_XML/P300_SpatialFilters_*_10Rep.xml
 *  - \c /openvibe/BoxSettings_XML/P300_SpatialFilters_*_8Rep.xml
 *  - \c /openvibe/BoxSettings_XML/P300_SpatialFilters_*_5Rep.xml
 *  - \c /openvibe/BoxSettings_XML/P300_SpatialFilters_*_3Rep.xml
 *
 * And the Na誰ve Bayes classifier settings are stored respectably for 10, 8, 5 and 3 repetitions
 * in the following files:
 *  - \c /openvibe/BoxSettings_XML/P300_NaiveBayes_Apply_*_10Rep.bin
 *  - \c /openvibe/BoxSettings_XML/P300_NaiveBayes_Apply_*_8Rep.bin
 *  - \c /openvibe/BoxSettings_XML/P300_NaiveBayes_Apply_*_5Rep.bin
 *  - \c /openvibe/BoxSettings_XML/P300_NaiveBayes_Apply_*_3Rep.bin

 *   and to count the number of times this symbol was intensified.
 * - After all flashes were presented, the stimulator presents the symbol selected by the OpenViBE
 *   P300 Speller scenario via a VRPN protocol.

 * - Identical to the Learning phase
 *
 * \subsubsection Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Protocol_Step3_OpenViBEScenario OpenViBE scenario:
 *
 * - Configuration of Acquisition server : Identical to the Learning phase
 * - Select and open the scenario entitled \c P300_OnLine_SF_NB_10rep.xml
 *
 * \image html Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Image5.png
 *
 * - It is composed of:
 *   - <em>Acquisition client Box</em>: identical to the learning phase settings 
 *   - <em>Channel selector Box</em>: restrict outgoing signal data to a subset data based on a
 *     list of channels, ie select only the 32 EEG channels in a case for which there are
 *     supplementary channels such as EOG.
 *   - <em>Temporal Filter Box</em>: digitally filter EEG signal with a band-pass filter
 *     (Butterworth filter, 0.1-20 Hz, slope 24 dB/octave)
 *   - <em>Spatial Filter Box</em>: apply a matrix which represents the spatial pattern
 *     determined by a method for producing enhanced EEG information related to a selected
 *     brain activity. In this scenario, the matrix was computed by the previous step (2nd
 *     step: Matlab procedure) and stored in the XML file \c P300_SpatialFilters_*_*Rep.xml.
 * \image html Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Image6.png
 *   - <em>Stimulation based epoching Box</em>: generates epochs upon reception of a given
 *     stimulation. In this scenario, the Epoch duration is equal to 600 ms without epoch
 *     offset. Moreover, 6 epoching boxes for stimulation sent when a row was intensified
 *     are used with Stimulation Label named at \c OVTK_StimulationId_Label_01 to and 
 *     \c OVTK_StimulationId_Label_06. For the columns, 6 other epoching boxes with Stimulation
 *     Label named at \c OVTK_StimulationId_Label_07 to and \c OVTK_StimulationId_Label_0C
 *     (\c OVTK_StimulationId_Label_0A, \c OVTK_StimulationId_Label_0B,
 *     \c OVTK_StimulationId_Label_0C correspond respectively to \c Label_10, \c Label_11
 *     and \c Label_12).
 * \image html Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Image7.png
 *   - <em>Epoch average Box</em>: average a number of epochs fixed in Epoch count setting.
 *     In the P300 Speller scenario, the Epoch count corresponds to the number of repetitions
 *     fixed in settings file of the P300 speller stimulator, in this case, 10 repetitions.
 * \image html Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Image8.png
 *   - <em>Linear Na誰ve Bayes Apply Box</em>: process a Linear Na誰ve Bayes analysis on time
 *     samples of averaged signals computed by <em>Epoch average Box</em>. One box is used to detect
 *     which is the intensified row that evokes a P300 response and another box for the column.
 *     Each box has 6 inputs connected to the output of the 6 Epoch average boxes. This box
 *     contains a Linear Na誰ve Bayes apply algorithms for each input. The Linear Na誰ve Bayes
 *     classifier settings were computed by the previous step (2nd step: Matlab procedure) and
 *     stored in the BIN file \c P300_NaiveBayes_Apply_*_*Rep.bin. 
 * \image html Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Image9.png
 *   - <em>Analog VRPN Sever Box</em>: creates VRPN analog servers to send data to VRPN client
 *     application configured in the P300 Speller Stimulator. It has 2 inputs; one was connected
 *     to the Linear Na誰ve Bayes Box output for the rows and the other one for the columns.
 * \image html Doc_Scenario_InsermP300Speller_Image10.png
